                        It seems that no section of the country was untouched by enterpreneurs seeking relief from the 
                        effects of the government shutdown in reaction to the Coronavirus. The release of

                         albeit under unfortunate circumstances,
                        allows an unusual glimpse into small businesses
                        affected by the crisis.

                            <h2>Initial analysis</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of the loans was to help businesses save jobs. The potential expenditure per capita of funds for the larger
                                loan amounts came in at $2,000 and the under $150k disbursements at $8,000 per job saved. This assessment is 
                                 based on calculations infered from statements Steve Mnuchin 
                                made, namely that the sum of the loans over $150k account for 75% of the total lent and was borrowed by only 
                                13% of enterprises.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Machine learning also suggested a dependency between number of jobs "saved" and loan ammounts as it gave this feature the 
                                most weight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though the largest of loans went to seemingly the largest employers, the question arises as to how effective $2000 per job would be in helping employees in comparison
                                to the smaller business loans which had a higher amount of money per person ratio.

                        <h2>The next step</h2>
                        <p> There is a lot here, and the number of lines of inquiry seem potentially endless. A few ideas 
                            are to obtain granularity on loan dispersement per job saved in various categories, regional lending 
                            differences such as rural
                            vs urban, differences between banks in various states.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of many candidates for deeper analysis is a racially based observation for loans under $150k 
                            is that Asians borrowed almost twice as much as Hispanics did while only
                        being one third the size of the Hispanic population. There could be any number of reasons for this but examining
                        rates of self employment, business types and/or cultural attitudes towards business investment may be illuminating. 
                        Additionally, it is 
                        possible that Asians answered the racial inquiry more often than Hispanics which would skew the results.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The above being said, the next step in the process is using SQL relational databases for ease of combining sources 
                        and to visualize the results with Tableau. The repository for these applications is linked below.
                        </p> 
                        <p>Application of big data and machine learning techniques form the basis of the first part of a journey to see what stories are revealed 
                        and where to focus granular analysis in order to understand more about this ongoing economic crisis at a human and macro level.
