                            <h2>Initial analysis</h2>
                            <p>The purpose of the loans was to help businesses save jobs. The potential expenditure per capita of funds for the larger
                                loan amounts came in at $2,000 and the under $150k disbursements at $8,000 per job saved. This assessment is 
                                 based on calculations infered from statements Steve Mnuchin 
                                made, namely that the sum of the loans over $150k account for 75% of the total lent and was borrowed by only 
                                13% of enterprises.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Machine learning also suggested a dependency between number of jobs "saved" and loan ammounts as it gave this feature the 
                                most weight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even though the largest of loans went to seemingly the largest employers, the question arises as to how effective $2000 per job would be in helping employees in comparison
                                to the smaller business loans which had a higher amount of money per person ratio.

                        <p> There is a lot here, and the number of lines of inquiry seem potentially endless. A few ideas 
                            are to obtain granularity on loan dispersement per job saved in various categories, regional lending 
                            differences such as rural
                            vs urban, differences between banks in various states.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of many candidates for deeper analysis is how the loan information provides insight into 
                            various ethnic groups. For example, Asians borrowed almost twice as much as Hispanics while only
                        being one third the size of the Hispanic population. There could be any number of reasons for this but examining
                        rates of self employment, business types and/or cultural attitudes towards business investment may be illuminating. 
                        Additionally, it is 
                        possible that Asians answered the racial inquiry more often than Hispanics which would skew the results.   
                        </p>

                        <h2>A personal note</h2>
                        <p>
                        Small business is often touted as the "back bone" of America, and yet it seems that a mandate in reaction 
                        to a virus "cut business owners off at the knees". Even though this was mostly a pipeline project for me, compassion 
                        for the extreme nature of what small business people are experiencing led me to look at not only the general trends in 
                        an attempt to understand the effects Covid is having on our economy, I found myself being incessantly intrigued by 
                        what the data suggests about individual establishments and outliers. Some of my favorite restaurants, professional organizations, 
                        colleagues and friends appear in 
                        this database, and I am grateful for the support that this program has afforded everyone. From the perspective of 
                        investigating data outliers, there were also unexpected findings such as that a "spa" for pets in Southern California
                        received a loan north of $1 million while most of the "people spas" received loans well under 50k. I found a business (pictured below) that received 
                        potentially $3 million from the PPP with one review on Google in a foreign language, and a residential address.
